description: "The project is conceived to improve this situation, giving tools to
  the students and the educational centers to help pupils develop a critical eye in
  front of the media. \n\nI created an app that will teach the users to analyze the
  color in the audiovisual content through movies. The app uses mini-games that lead
  to the analysis of several films, where the user interacts to discover the meaning
  of color actively."

problema: 'The new generations are continuously bombed by audiovisual content, but
  they did not receive a formation to help them understand the audiovisual narrative.
  So, they keep being passive spectators and, therefore, manipulable. '
