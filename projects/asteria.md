title: Asteria
description: "Asteria is a transmedia project about a future where genetic modification
  is possible. \n\nThe main idea is to create an interactive installation in which
  the user can interact with other platforms. This installation will represent a genetic
  clinic called Asteria, where the user will be able to choose the features of their
  future child. The main aim of the project is to open a debate and reflection on
  whether we are ready for this use of power or not."

    descripcion: "I was in charge of all the documentation from a scientific point
      of view. We wanted to be as accurate as possible to reality, so I researched
      genetic engineering. I am passionate about the world of biology, especially
      genetics, and from the second year of my degree in my free time, I attend classes
      in the biotechnology degree as a listener. That is why I was delighted to do
      all the documentation. I asked for all the notes on any subject related to genetics.
      Plus, I went to the library on weekends to investigate. Once all the research
      was done, I organized some basic genetics classes for the whole group, so we
      all knew what we are working with. \n\nThis was very useful during the presentation
      and as long as the installation was operative. Since practically all the questions
      we received were technical about genetics, when someone asked something more
      complicated, the other team members came looking for me to give the pertinent
      explanations. And it was all a success since we were able to solve all the doubts!
      \n\nAdditionally, all the departments have performed deep research focuses on
      references."

  descripcion: As director of the multimedia department, I was in charge of the entire
    department practically alone. In the installation, I wanted to provide immersion
    to the user, and that is why everything that surrounds the viewer stimulates and
    brings them into the reality that we propose.

    titulo: Totem
    descripcion: |-
      There are five totems in total; in them, the user must answer the doctor's questionnaire thru a video. The answers are given by putting the hand in the top of one of the three illuminated zones

      To carry out the interactions of the totems, we have created a website. This website is connected through Socket.io to a server programmed with node.js, which is connected to Arduino by UDP. When the user finishes, uploads all the responses to the mongo database and restarts the program. To be able to perform all these interactions at the same time, we have used promises within asynchronous functions

    titulo: Data representation
    descripcion: |
      There are ten tubes (one for each question). These are filled with liquids of different densities. Like that, we could represent the % of questionnaire answers in real-time. We use peristaltic pumps, each of them connected to an Arduino.

      The Arduinos were connected to the same mongo base as the totems. Every few seconds, they check for a new answer pack. If there were, the pumps corresponding to those responses would activate, filling the tubes with liquid.
