title: Asteria
description: "Asteria is a transmedia project about a future where genetic modification
  is possible. \n\nThe main idea is to create an interactive installation in which
  the user can interact with other platforms. This installation will represent a genetic
  clinic called Asteria, where the user will be able to choose the features of their
  future child. The main aim of the project is to open a debate and reflection on
  whether we are ready for this use of power or not."

    descripcion: "I was in charge of all the documentation from a scientific point
      of view. We wanted to be as accurate as possible to reality, so I researched
      genetic engineering. I am passionate about the world of biology, especially
      genetics, and from the second year of my degree in my free time, I attend classes
      in the biotechnology degree as a listener. That is why I was delighted to do
      all the documentation. I asked for all the notes on any subject related to genetics.
      Plus, I went to the library on weekends to investigate. Once all the research
      was done, I organized some basic genetics classes for the whole group, so we
      all knew what we are working with. \n\nThis was very useful during the presentation
      and as long as the installation was operative. Since practically all the questions
      we received were technical about genetics, when someone asked something more
      complicated, the other team members came looking for me to give the pertinent
      explanations. And it was all a success since we were able to solve all the doubts!
      \n\nAdditionally, all the departments have performed deep research focuses on
      references."
