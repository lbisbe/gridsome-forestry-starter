title: Asteria
description: "Asteria is a transmedia project about a future where genetic modification
  is possible. \n\nThe main idea is to create an interactive installation in which
  the user can interact with other platforms. This installation will represent a genetic
  clinic called Asteria, where the user will be able to choose the features of their
  future child. The main aim of the project is to open a debate and reflection on
  whether we are ready for this use of power or not."
